----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------> 
   
Broken Age is a timeless coming-of-age story of barfing
trees and talking spoons. Vella Tartine and Shay Volta 
are two teenagers in strangely similar situations, but 
radically different worlds. The player can freely
switch between their stories, helping them take control
of their own lives, and dealing with the unexpected 
adventures that follow.

Key Features:

- Original soundtrack, composed by Peter McConnell,
recorded by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra

- All-star voice cast, including Elijah Wood, 
Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, Masasa Moyo, Wil Wheaton,
and Pendleton Ward

- Dialog Trees!

- Some jokes. Unless you don't think they're funny, 
in which case we totally weren't trying to be funny

- A whole bunch of awesome PUZZLES

- This one really hard puzzle that you won't get but
you'll look it up online and not tell anybody

- All your hopes and dreams
